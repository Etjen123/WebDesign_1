		<h2>Interests</h2>
	<p>I have always been attracted to computers and at some point I started to code. I find it very interesting to be able to build something on your own. Technology is evolving every day and in order to keep up one must always learn new techniques. It is an area of study where there is no such things as too much information. That is why it is important to learn a variety of courses in order to have a solid background. With so much recourse today it is not so important to be able to produce the code rather than being able to read and understand it</p>

		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<p>I like watching tv-series a lot involving different topics in areas such as politics, superheroes, history, engineering, law firms and psychology. Also I like playing sports a lot. My favorites one are football, basketball, swimming, airsoft. For the last one I would like to explain that it a better version of paintball where the guns that you carry have the weight of a real weapon and it involves a enormous playing ground like a mountain for example. In Albania there is an official association of Airsoft and with the nature that you find there the game turns out to be amazing</p>

		<h2>Activities</h2>
	<p>I am part of AUBG Olympics. This is an organization here at the American University in Bulgaria that is in charge of most of the sport activities. I find this very helpful since in this organization it is essential to be able to work in team. Time management and teamwork are the main thing. I also like clubbing. My favorite bars are Piano Bar Limited and Underground. What attracts me about this club is that they organize Karaoke where I can sing with my friends</p>
